    "This notebook follows a 1 hour tutorial/lecture covering some of the basics of Python. By this point in the workshop, you will have created a working environment with the necessary packages, and will be ready to import the ones you expect to use. This can be done in any cell in the notebook, but is best done at the top to keep track. The notebook will cover how to create and manipulate arrays, how to use python's object-oriented class structures, and some advice on how to make sure your code stays reasonably performant."
